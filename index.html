 Welcome everybody, ladies and gentlemens ! We're here today to share the Mistaken project... Because our futur is also <a href="image/img cic.jpg"> yours!</a>

<h2>What's The "MISTAKEN"?</h2>
<p>The Mistaken are our life long project that we created on accident ! LUCKY US :) ...
To be honest we always wanted to try to find a remedy for sadness and depression, an sort of happy pill. But affordable and creative not some sort of drugs or hippy' type of "candies". And an a day when i wanted to stop it all i saw a light , i saw what perfection was like and how i was the biggest mistake of my life. And here we are , i'm not everyone but the Mistaken that were sent for all of you. I created the serum that once injected, you start to melt out of joy and you smile will stick to you all of your life ! Ahahah, it feels so good to see every people of lights and beyonds...But once you did it there's no coming back.</p>
